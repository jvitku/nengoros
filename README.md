NengoRos
=========

This is [Nengo-ros](http://nengoros.wordpress.com), a tool which merges [Nengo](https://github.com/ctn-waterloo/nengo_1.4) and [rosjava_core](https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core) in order to simulate large-scale hybrid neural systems capable of interfacing with real robotic systems. 

Author Jaroslav Vitku, research under [Alife group]((http://artificiallife.co.nf/projects/) on [Department of Cybernetics](http://cyber.felk.cvut.cz/) on CTU in Prague. 

The simulator is composed of the following parts (all credits to their authors):

* [Nengo simulator](http://nengo.ca/) - large scale neural simulations (original readme moved to `nengo/README_origNengo.rst`)
* [Rosjava_core](http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava) - java-based implementation of ROS core

	-and potentially with some necessary ROS-components (e.g. [messages](http://wiki.ros.org/std_msgs)) included

Together, these packages provide mostly platform-independent **tool for simulating hybrid neural systems** usable e.g. for experiments with e.g.:

* cognitive modeling
* neuro-evolution
* running simulations of hybrid modular systems composed of arbitrary reusable ([ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/)) nodes
* direct robot control
* ...and much more.





Prerequisites:
-------------
##### Download additional python-based ROS **wstool** and init it:

	pip install -U wstool
	

* or download and "python setup.py install" them from [here](https://github.com/vcstools/)
* or "sudo apt-get install python-wstool" on linux


 
##### Create python **virtualenv** called nengoros (optional):

* download fortran

		brew install gfortran

* download virtualenv and wrapper

		sudo pip install virtualenv
		sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper

* create ~/.virtualenvs directory

		source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh 
	
* create your virtualenv

		mkvirtualenv nengoros
		source ~/.virtualenvs/nengoros/bin/activate
 

##### Install **scipy** and **numpy** (also optional):

	pip install numpy	
	pip install scipy


Installation:
--------------

* Make folder with workspace:

		mkdir -p ~/workspace && cd ~/workspace
	
* In case of ROS not installed, point the ROS\_PACKAGE_PATH into this folder (add to your ~/.profie or ~/.bashrc file )

		export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/workspace
	
* Download Nengoros configuration:

		git clone -b nengoros-master-v0.0.2 https://github.com/jvitku/nengoros.git

	
* Download all repositories and install them (./tool -h)

		cd nengoros
		./tool -unrf


* In Eclipse, import all auto-generated projects from nengoros folder (it is necessary to check the check-box `search for nested projects`, and after importing delete the projectTemplate), clean & build them in Eclipse. 

Running
---------

* Now the simulator can be launched from class files generated by Eclipse. In order to [launch GUI](http://nengo.ca/docs/html/tutorial1.html), start the script under nengo/simulator-ui:

		./nengo
	
* In order to launch [command-line interface](http://nengo.ca/docs/html/scripting_interface.html#running-scripts-from-the-command-line), start the:

		./nengo-cl




Demos
-------

To launch jython script, open Nengo GUI, open command line interface and write command as:
	
	run nr-demo/gates/logic_crisp_gates.py

There are two choices how to learn with NengoROS:

##### Learn with Nengo part:
	
* All demos of original Nengo simulator are unchanged and can be found under `nengo/simulator-ui/demo`
* To see detailed information about these demo, go to [Nengo demos](http://nengo.ca/docs/html/tutorial.html) from Waterloo University.

##### Learn with Nengo-ROS part:

* These simple demos show how the modified Nengo can employ ROS nodes in the simulation.
* The demo scripts can be found under: `nengo/simulatori-ui/nr-demo`
* The Nengoros currently features sub-project `demonodes`, where all demos are placed, see its [readme](https://github.com/jvitku/demonodes) for all information.
* To se more information go to [Nengoros tutorials](http://nengoros.wordpress.com/tutorials/). 






	
Additional information
-----------------------

###Alternative ways to launch NengoROS:

* to install Nengo is by running `./gradlew installApp` from the nengo/simulator-ui folder, launch nengo by running: `nengo/simulator-ui/build/install/simulator-ui/bin/simulator-ui`.
 	
	
	* Note under Linux, Gradle has problem following symlinks, symlinked files should be copied directly on their place (mainly `nengo/simulator-ui/python` .. `/nr-demo`)

* To launch everything from jar files: modify the `nengo` (`nengo-cl`) scripts appropriately to add to class-path also `simulator/lib` and `simulator-ui/lib/` jars.



###Choices of installation:

The currently supported is **complete** version:

####complete:
*	does not require any other ROS packages and contains ALL additional rosjava nodes (other can be added) and these are supported by nengo GUI
* 	this is preferred and the most stable version

####rosbased:
*	use if you managed to install ROS infrastructure
		
####standalone:   
*	this is similar to "complete" without additional rosjava nodes
*	this version is now deprecated, the nengo GUI layout requires nodes contained in "complete.rosinstall" version
*	use if you managed to install ROS infrastructure and you do not want all nodes 


		
In case you want to choose which version to use, e.g. for rosbased (creates .rosinstal file):

	wstool init -j8 . rosbased.rosinstall

Run the tool script:

	./tool -unrf
	
..this will:

* 	update all repositories from remote
*	compile rosjava_core and install it into ~/.m2 repository
*	compile and install other nengoros components (e.g. install jroscore into ~/.m2 repo and creates runnable application under `jroscore` folder etc..)



###Information about updating Nengoros:

THe script tool can update all projects from remote repositories:

		./tool -h
